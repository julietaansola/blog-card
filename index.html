				<h1>Finding Nemo in Sharm el-sheikh</h1>
				<h2>Ras Mohammed National Park</h2>
				<p>
					Four years ago I traveled for the first time to Egypt. At first I was
					not sure of going, however I liked it so much that I went the next
					year again. In Sharm el-Sheik there is an underwater park called Ras
					Mohamed, a beautiful place where people go diving, but I can't do it
					because I have an ear operated, however I did snorkel there for the
					first time, and I loved it: it was how to dive into a new world and
					feel like I was in the movie Finding Nemo

				<h1>Egypt</h1>
				<h2>Giza pyramids</h2>
				<p>
					One of my dreams was to get to know the pyramids of giza, because when
					I was a child I always read books of pharaohs and sphinxes. I did not
					know if one day I could go, however to my surprise I was working there
					for a month! It was a hard month because it was very hot, but I
					learned a lot about the culture of that country and especially about
					its food. I love to discover a country through its food!
